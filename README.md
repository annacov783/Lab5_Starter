1. It would not be an adequate choice to utilize a unit test for the entire functionality of the "message" feature. This is because there are several aspects within this feature that should be tested, rather than one test for general functionality. Unit tests should be applied on the smaller parts associated with the feature. 
   
2. A unit test may be used to test the "max message length" feature of a message. This is an individual smaller portion of the message feature. If a test were applied on this particular section, it would be easier to debug an issue if one were to arise in that area. The functionality of this feature is relatively simpler compared to the entire "message" feature.
